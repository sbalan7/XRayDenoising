# X Ray Denoising

Testing image processing algorithms on X Ray images from NASA's [Chandra Data Photo Album](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/). 

### Why X Ray Data?

X Ray Data has funny diffuse features as well as fine point sources and sometimes both. Noise and denoising algorithms probably affect these different kinds of images in interesting ways and this study aims to test that.
